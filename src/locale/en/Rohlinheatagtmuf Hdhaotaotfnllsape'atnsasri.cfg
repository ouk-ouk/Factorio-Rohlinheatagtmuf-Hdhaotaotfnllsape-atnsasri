Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri=Requirement of having lamps is not heavily enforced as they are generally the most useless fixtures. However, distributing high amount of them all over the factory no longer looks like such a pointless exercise, after the night stoped appearing so ridiculously inconsequantial.

[mod-description]
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri=Allows to adjust length of the day and choose brightness and color of the night, zoom-to-map, night-vision and so on.\n(This is a purely graphical change which does not affect the game mechanics.)\nBy default it is set to dark night, green nightvision and desaturated zoom-to-map.\n\n"Factory moves fast,\ngrowth and maintenance required,\nnature does not let."

Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-identity=It's used in the vanilla game for colors during the day both in the game and the zoom to map.\nIt doesn't change the original colors at all.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-vanilla_day=It's found in the vanilla game but it doesn't seem to be used.\nIt makes colors brighter and more saturated. (It's rather intense on the eyes.)
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-vanilla_night=It's used in the vanilla game for colors during the night in the game.\nIt makes everything darker and adds a blue tint but generally you can still see and play normally. (Slightly darker than the "Vanilla night for map".)
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-vanilla_mapNight=It's used in the vanilla game for colors during the night both in the game and the zoom to map.\nIt makes everything darker and adds a blue tint but generally you can still see and play normally. (Slightly brighter than the "Vanilla night")
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-vanilla_nightVision=It's used in the vanilla game for colors while the night vision is active.\nIt makes everything a little darker and somewhat desaturated but you can still play normally.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_grayNight=It's similar to the "Vanilla night" (the same brightness) but all colors are completly desaturated. (Looks a little artificial in comparison to the "Blue night".)\nYou can still play more or less normally but you may have a problem to distinguish different types of belts, inserters and such.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_blueNight=It's similar to the "Vanilla night" (the same brightness) but all colors are completly desaturated and have a blue tint. (It looks more natural that the "Gray night" and is nicer for the eye.)\nYou can still play more or less normally but you may have a problem to distinguish different types of belts, inserters and such.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_darkNight=The colors are like the "Vanilla night" but it's much darker.\nDepending on your monitor and setting you may not be able to navigate without a light source.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_grayDarkNight=It's much darker than the "Vanilla night" and all colors are completly desaturated. (Looks a little artificial in comparison to the "Blue dark night".)\nDepending on your monitor and setting you may not be able to navigate without a light source and even if you are, you will have a problem to distinguish different types of belts, inserters and such.

(It looks more natural that the "Gray dark night" and is nicer for the eye.)\nDepending on your monitor and setting you may not be able to navigate without a light source and even if you are, you will have a problem to distinguish different types of belts, inserters and such.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_black=It's completly black.\nYou won't be able to play without a light source.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_greenishNightVision=It has the same brightness as the "Vanilla night vision" but adds a green filter.\nYou should still be able to distinguish colors and play normally.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_grayNightVision=It has the same brightness as the "Vanilla night vision" but everything is gray.\nYou won't be able to distinguish colors which makes building harder but you should be able to fight normally.
Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri-<group>_<target>_colors-mod_greenNightVision=It has the same brightness as the "Vanilla night vision" but everything is green.\nYou won't be able to distinguish colors which makes building harder but you should be able to fight normally.
